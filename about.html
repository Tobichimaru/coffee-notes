<p>Hello, besties!</p>

<p>I am a Site Reliability Engineer with a software development background.
One of my hobbies is constant learning and creating valuable memos for the material. 
 </p>

<p>Like most software engineers, my fuel is pure black coffee, so you can support my endeavours by sharing a cup of coffee with me.
Hope you find the content helpful! If you have any requests please free to contact me.
